# UTERM-002: Command Palette

**Status:** accepted
**Created:** 2026-10-31
**Updated:** 2026-11-01

## Dependencies

- UTERM-001

## Impacts

- UTERM-001 — "How applets publish tabs": the applet contract gains a tab list, a change signal, and tab IDs
- UTERM-001 — "Command source": every key binding, including those of M1, M2, M5, and M7, moves onto the command
  registry, except the standard edit actions
- UTERM-003 — "How applets publish tabs": the scripting API may expose the same entries and tab IDs
- UTERM-003 — "Command source": scripts may invoke registry commands and register their own, on the main thread
- UTERM-005 through UTERM-010 — "How applets publish tabs" and "Applets without tabs": every applet publishes at least
  one tab. Image, map, and canvas applets publish one tab for their whole session, with the per-tab duties the
  contract carries

## Summary

Each window gets a command palette region. The palette can float or dock. It finds and jumps to any tab of any applet
in the window, and runs commands.

## Motivation

A window can hold many panes, and each applet can hold many tabs. Finding one by eye gets slow. A palette gives one
keyboard path to every tab and every command.

## Design Decisions (Settled)

### The palette is a region

The palette is a region, as defined in UTERM-001. Its role is fixed. Its mode and position are settings.

### Two modes

- **Floating.** Hidden by default. A hotkey shows it over the window. It takes focus while shown.
- **Docked.** Always visible at the top or the bottom of the window. It does not take focus until the hotkey activates
  it.

### Applets publish their tabs

Applets make their tabs findable in the palette. Choosing an entry focuses that pane and switches to that tab. When a
tab closes, its entry disappears.

### Commands

The palette also runs commands, such as split pane, close pane, and new window. Commands and tabs share one search.

### How applets publish tabs

Original question: register and unregister calls, the palette querying applets when it opens, or an observable model
the palette subscribes to?

Decision: a live query from the pane tree.

- The applet contract gains a current tab list and a change signal. Each tab descriptor carries a tab ID, a title, and
  detail fields such as a working directory.
- A tab ID is never reused, even across a relaunch, so a stale ID never resolves to a different tab. Tab IDs are not
  persisted. Amended 2026-11-01; see Decision Log.
- The palette walks the window's pane tree for its entries. While it shows, it re-reads a pane's list on that pane's
  change signal. It re-walks the tree on the content area's layout-change signal, the same one layout persistence
  saves on.
- An entry targets a pane by its stable pane ID, per ADR-02, and a tab by its tab ID. Never by a row, tree path, or tab
  index.
- Choosing an entry whose pane or tab is gone changes nothing else. It refreshes the list and posts a status message.
- Hidden grace-tier panes are not in the tree, so their tabs do not appear.

Rationale: the applet's own state is the only source, so nothing can go stale and nothing needs unregistering. A query
on open breaks "when a tab closes, its entry disappears" in docked mode, where the palette may stay active for a long
time. Register and unregister keeps a second copy of tab state that drifts when a pane is torn down on an error path.
An observable model is one way to build the change signal, not a separate design. A per-pane signal alone cannot
report a pane created while the palette shows, such as by a split or an undo, so the layout-change signal covers that.

This extends UTERM-001's applet contract. UTERM-001 expected the contract to change when a second consumer arrived.

### Command source

Original questions: whether commands are declared in Swift only, or also in Janet once UTERM-003 lands; and whether
the palette should eventually call the Janet API for every command.

Decision: a uniterm command registry in Swift, shared by the palette and uniterm's key bindings. Amended 2026-11-02;
see Decision Log.

- Each command has a stable ID, a title, a run action, and an availability check.
- A command targets the pane that had focus before the palette activated, the same pane Escape returns to. It never
  targets the palette itself.
- A run action is synchronous and runs on the main thread. An action may start UI, such as the applet chooser or a
  close confirmation, and return before the user answers.
- A key binding and its palette command run the same registry action. Outside the palette's field, Cmd-W and the
  palette's close command behave the same, including UTERM-001's close confirmations. UTERM-001's key bindings move
  onto the registry, except the standard edit actions.
- The standard edit actions are not registry commands. Cut, copy, paste, select all, undo, and redo stay responder-chain
  items, per UTERM-013. A registry command would act on the pane, not on a find field or address bar inside it.
- While the palette's search field has focus, text-editing chords go to the field: cut, copy, paste, select all, undo,
  and redo. This follows UTERM-001's rule that Cmd-Z in a focused text control undoes the edit.
- A key, a menu item, and the palette all reach a command's action through one dispatch point in the window. It applies
  the palette's rules below, so a key and a menu item chosen with the mouse cannot differ.
- This proposal builds Swift commands only. The palette runs commands through the registry, never through the Janet
  API.
- UTERM-003 may invoke registry commands, and may register its own. That work belongs to UTERM-003. A Janet caller
  hops to the main thread to run an action.

Rationale: one run action per command keeps the palette from drifting from the key binding's meaning, such as Cmd-W
closing a tab rather than the pane. Routing every Enter through Janet would tie the palette to a VM whose thread model
UTERM-003 has not settled. It runs under a watchdog, and UTERM-004's control levels would gate built-in commands
meant for the user. Declaring Janet commands here would make this proposal wait on a draft.

Leaves undone: this proposal does not make app menus read the registry. UTERM-013 does that, and adds a default key
and a menu home to each entry.

### Hotkey default

Original question: the default hotkey for each mode.

Decision: Cmd-Shift-P for both modes. One action, "activate the palette", toggles it.

- In floating mode it shows the palette, and pressing it again hides it.
- In docked mode it focuses the palette, and pressing it again unfocuses it.
- Hiding or unfocusing returns focus to the pane that had it before activation.

Rationale: macOS terminals never pass Cmd chords to the pty, so a Cmd chord cannot collide with a terminal program's
shortcut. Cmd-Shift-P is free among UTERM-001's bindings and matches VS Code, Sublime Text, and Ghostty's own palette.
Cmd-K is clear screen, which UTERM-001 binds. Cmd-P breaks the Print convention. A hotkey per mode would make users
relearn it when they switch modes. The macOS Page Setup convention on Cmd-Shift-P does not apply, since uniterm has no
print path.

### Hotkey configurability

Original question: whether the hotkey is configurable in this proposal.

Decision: the palette action is a menu item with a fixed title, "Show Command Palette", and Cmd-Shift-P as its key
equivalent. Users rebind it through System Settings > Keyboard > App Shortcuts, which remaps a menu item by its title.
No in-app binding setting is built here. General key-binding customization would be its own proposal. Amended
2026-11-01; see Decision Log.

Constraint: the palette's key equivalent must reach uniterm before a focused terminal surface takes the key. ADR-04
already clears libghostty's own bindings. Every uniterm binding except the standard edit actions runs a registry
command, per "Command source". Whether a binding is delivered as a menu key equivalent or by a key handler is an
implementation detail. Either way it must not shadow a user's App Shortcuts remap without the user seeing it in the
menu.

Rationale: it follows the platform convention and is discoverable from the menu bar. It builds no settings surface. A
recorder for this one shortcut would need a collision check that knows every uniterm binding, including later ones, and
would drift when bindings are added. A general binding system adds scope well past the palette.

Leaves undone: there is no in-app rebinding. A remap onto another uniterm binding, or onto a Ctrl or Option chord a
terminal program uses, gets no collision warning.

### Search scope

Original question: whether the palette searches only the current window, or every window.

Decision: the current window only. The palette lists the tabs of its own window's pane tree. Reaching a tab in another
window means switching windows first, such as with Cmd-`.

Rationale: the Summary scopes the palette to "any tab of any applet in the window", and the publishing decision walks
the window's pane tree. Searching every window would be a scope addition. It would need an app-level window-list
signal, so that a window closing behind the palette drops its entries. It would also need a window identity that
UTERM-001 does not define. This choice is not a one-way door. A later proposal can add a window identity to each entry.

Leaves undone: no cross-window tab search.

### Ranking

Original question: how results rank, by fuzzy match, recency, or both.

Decision: both, with match quality first.

- A fuzzy subsequence match filters and scores entries over titles and detail fields. A title match outranks a match
  only in detail fields.
- Recency breaks ties and adds a bounded boost. The bound keeps a strong match above a weak recent one.
- An empty query lists tabs by most recent focus, then commands by most recent run. Entries with no recency follow:
  tabs in tree order, commands alphabetically.
- Recency is kept in memory for the life of the process and is never persisted. Command recency is one list for the
  app.
- Each entry shows whether it is a tab or a command.

Rationale: jumping back to a recent tab is the main use, and recency serves it without letting a recent weak match
win. Recency alone ranks a recently run "Close Window" above an exact "Close Pane". Fuzzy alone buries the tab the
user just left. Persisting command recency would add a stored contract read across app versions, with no failure it
fixes. Tab IDs do not survive a relaunch anyway. Programs set tab titles, so a tab titled "Close Window" must not pass
for a command.

### Other key bindings while the palette's field has focus

Original question: text-editing chords go to the field. What do the other registry bindings do while the field has
focus, such as Cmd-W, Cmd-T, or Cmd-D?

Decision: Cmd-W dismisses the palette. Every other binding except the palette's toggle dismisses it, then runs as if
it had not been open.

- Cmd-W hides a floating palette and unfocuses a docked one. Focus returns to the pane that had it before activation.
  This is a dispatch rule, not a command aimed at the palette.
- The palette's own toggle hides or unfocuses it, per "Hotkey default", and runs nothing else.
- Any other registry binding dismisses the palette the same way, then runs its action on the pane that had focus
  before activation.
- When that pane is gone, a pane-scoped binding posts a status message instead of acting on another pane.

Rationale: users press Cmd-W to dismiss what is in front. Running close instead would remove the current tab, and a
tab close at an idle prompt neither asks nor undoes. Consuming every binding would make Cmd-Q, Cmd-N, and Cmd-, do
nothing while the field has focus. Running bindings while the palette stays focused would make it compete for focus
with the applet chooser and close confirmations.

### Applets without tabs

Original question: an applet with no tabs, such as a later image viewer, would publish an empty list, and its pane
could never be reached from the palette. Should every pane be reachable, and how?

Decision: the applet contract requires at least one tab. An applet with no switchable sessions publishes one tab that
stands for its whole session, with its own tab ID, title, and detail. An empty tab list cannot be represented.

Rationale: UTERM-001's program-mode terminal already works this way, with one tab and no new-tab action. "Closing an
applet's last tab is a pane close" and the hidden one-tab bar then apply unchanged. The palette and UTERM-003 need no
second entry kind. Listing panes beside tabs would show every single-tab pane twice. Listing only tabs would leave
some panes unreachable, against the Motivation.

### Default mode and dock edge

Original question: which mode is the default, and which edge a docked palette uses by default.

Decision: floating by default. A docked palette defaults to the top edge. Mode and edge are two plain settings.

Rationale: floating costs no window space, and the write-up asks for as much space as possible. A top edge matches
the palette and omnibox convention. Making the palette follow the status bar's edge would couple two settings and
need a third "auto" value. M3's stacking order covers a palette and a status bar on the same edge, whatever the status
bar's default is.

### What an inactive docked palette shows

Original question: what a docked palette shows while inactive, and where its results list appears when it activates.
A list that grows the region resizes the content area, which resizes every terminal in the window.

Decision: while inactive, a docked palette shows a one-line field whose placeholder names the hotkey. On activation,
the results list appears as an overlay anchored to the field, drawn over the pane content. The content area keeps its
size. A click outside the overlay deactivates the palette and focuses what was clicked.

Rationale: growing the region would resize every terminal on each activation and deactivation. vim redraws, shells
reprint prompts, and scrollback reflows. It could also push panes below their minimum size. An overlay keeps search
the same as in floating mode, as M3 requires. A strip of recent tabs would either re-sort on every focus change or go
stale, and it would keep program-set titles on screen as click targets. An always-visible list takes rows from every
window.

## Design Decisions (Open)

## Risks

- **The palette hotkey collides with a shortcut in a terminal program** — likelihood: low, impact: medium.
  Mitigation: the default is a Cmd chord, which macOS terminals never pass to the pty. The hotkey is a window-level
  shortcut, not a system-wide one. A user remap onto a Ctrl or Option chord can still collide, and gets no warning.
- **Stale tab entries after an applet crashes** — likelihood: low, impact: low.
  Mitigation: entries come from a live query of the pane tree, so a torn-down pane takes its entries with it. An entry
  whose target is gone refreshes the list instead of acting.
- **The default hotkey becomes muscle memory** — likelihood: high, impact: low.
  Accepted: Cmd-Shift-P matches the common palette convention, so a later change is unlikely to be wanted.
- **The menu item title is a contract for users' App Shortcuts remaps** — likelihood: medium, impact: low.
  A rename, or a localization, silently drops every remap. Mitigation: the title is fixed and does not change with the
  palette's state. A rename is a deliberate change noted in release notes.
- **UTERM-003 calls the main-thread registry from a Janet thread** — likelihood: medium, impact: medium.
  UTERM-003's thread model is open. A Janet thread that blocks on a main-thread action, while the main thread waits on
  Janet, would deadlock or stall the UI. Mitigation: run actions and availability checks never wait on Janet. Run
  actions return once any UI they start is shown. UTERM-003 must settle how a script awaits an action without
  blocking the main thread, and how a Janet-registered command reports availability without the main thread waiting.
- **Moving UTERM-001's built key bindings onto the registry is rework** — likelihood: medium, impact: low.
  UTERM-001 is queued first, so its bindings exist before this proposal starts. Accepted: M1 moves them, and
  UTERM-001's binding checks still pass after the move.
- **A program-set tab title passes for a uniterm command** — likelihood: medium, impact: medium.
  Mitigation: each entry shows its kind. Titles and detail fields show with control and bidi characters neutralized.

## Milestones

### M1: Floating palette with commands

**Status:** DONE

Amended 2026-11-01; see Decision Log.

- A hotkey shows and hides a floating palette over the focused window
- Typing filters a list of built-in commands, and Enter runs the selected one
- Escape hides the palette and returns focus to the pane that had it
- "Show Command Palette" is a menu item with Cmd-Shift-P, and its title does not change while the palette shows
- With a terminal focused, Cmd-Shift-P reaches uniterm, not the terminal surface
- A palette command acts on the pane that had focus before the palette activated
- The palette's close command and Cmd-W outside the palette behave the same, including their confirmations
- With the palette's field focused, Cmd-W dismisses the palette and closes nothing. Cmd-T runs on the pane that had
  focus before activation, after the palette hides
- UTERM-001's key binding checks still pass once its bindings run through the registry
- The standard edit actions stay responder-chain items, not registry commands
- With the palette's field focused, Cmd-V pastes into the field and Cmd-Z undoes the field's edit, not a pane close
- When the pane focused before activation closes while the palette shows, Escape focuses a defined pane, and a
  pane-scoped command posts a status message instead of acting on another pane
- Hiding the palette never takes focus back from the applet chooser, a close confirmation, or a new window that a
  command opened
- A command that is unavailable for the target pane is either hidden or shown disabled, by one rule for all commands
- With the field focused, Cmd-Shift-P hides the palette and does not show it again
- After an App Shortcuts remap of "Show Command Palette" onto a chord another uniterm binding uses, the remapped item
  wins, including with a terminal focused
- File > Close chosen with the mouse runs the same registry action as Cmd-W
- With the field focused, a menu item chosen with the mouse behaves the same as its key binding
- A click outside the floating palette hides it and focuses what was clicked

**As built:**

The registry lives in a `Commands` area of WindowKit, not a new module. Its context carries the window
controller and the target pane, and the palette view needs the window's theme and pane area. A separate module would
need protocol indirection for nothing. UTERM-013 can extract it when applets register their own commands.

Every UTERM-001 binding is a registry command owned by uniterm, including the app ones (New Window, Settings, Hide,
Quit, Minimize) and the terminal ones. Terminal text size and clear reach the pane through a small AppletKit protocol
that the terminal applet implements. The menu items for them use selectors that the terminal view does not answer.
Otherwise the responder chain would reach the view first and skip the registry. The select-tab-by-number commands exist
but are not listed in the palette.

The palette-focused rules live in the window controller's dispatch point and not in the key route, so a menu item chosen
with the mouse behaves like its key. The key route in the window sends a key to the live menu item before the views,
and a remapped item wins over a default on the same key. The launcher that holds the keyboard is offered Cmd-1 to
Cmd-9 first. AppKit rewrites a menu item's key equivalent when a user remap applies, so the route reads the live items.

Constants, all recorded here and nowhere else: the palette is 560 points wide, never wider than the window less 16 on
each side, and sits 12 below the top of the pane area. It shows up to 8 rows of 28 points under a 40 point field. The
matcher scores 16 per matched character, with 12 for each consecutive pair, 10 for a word start, 8 for the first
character, 40 for a contiguous match, 40 more for a prefix, and up to 24 off for skipped characters. A title match sits
a tier above a detail-only match. Recency adds 24 for the newest command and 6 less for each older one. The registry
remembers 8 commands, and only commands the palette lists count toward that, so tab-number presses do not push them out.

The key route compares the character a key types, not the raw key. Cmd-Shift-= matches Bigger Text, which names "+",
and Delete matches Dismiss Message, which names 0x08. Shift is dropped from the comparison for keys that are not letters
or digits. Cmd-} and Cmd-Shift-] are not unified. An item and a key that differ in the character they type do not match.

Unavailable commands show disabled, ranked like any other, and Enter skips them. The arrow keys skip them too. A
pane-scoped command whose pane is gone counts as available, so choosing it posts a status message and acts on no other
pane. A press outside the palette that lands on something taking no keyboard returns the keyboard to the focused pane.

Two defects surfaced and were fixed. Cmd-Z in a field editor that keeps its own undo manager did nothing, so the window
now undoes through the editor's manager. The app's own Quit item is no longer AppKit's, so it did not disable itself
while a quit question was open, and a second Cmd-Q cancelled the question. It now disables itself the same way.

Residuals: a remap onto another uniterm binding or a terminal's Control chord gets no collision warning, as decided. The
hide path that must not take the keyboard from a sheet is covered by a unit test of the rule and by the close and quit
UI tests, not by a test that drives a sheet over a showing palette. The palette lists "Toggle Message History" under a
fixed title, while the menu item still retitles itself.

### M2: Tab search

**Status:** NOT STARTED

- Every terminal tab in the window appears in the palette
- Choosing a tab focuses its pane and switches to that tab
- A closed tab no longer appears, including one that closes while the palette shows
- A pane created while the palette shows, such as by a split or an undo, has its tabs appear
- Enter acts on the highlighted entry's pane and tab IDs, even when the list re-sorts between the arrow key and Enter
- A burst of tab title changes does not move the selection or stall typing
- Choosing an entry whose tab is gone refreshes the list and posts a status message
- Tabs of hidden grace-tier panes do not appear
- Tab IDs never repeat across launches without persisted state. A restored tab gets a new ID, and an old ID resolves
  to gone
- On an empty query, the highlighted entry is the most recent tab other than the current one
- A prefix or contiguous title match outranks a recent scattered subsequence match
- A title match outranks a match found only in a tab's working directory
- Each entry shows whether it is a tab or a command. Tab titles and detail fields, such as an OSC 7 working directory,
  show with control and bidi characters neutralized
- Choosing a tab leaves focus on that tab, not on the pane that had focus before activation
- An entry for an applet's single implicit tab reads in a defined way, such as by the applet's title
- Tabs restored from the layout file, and commands never run, follow recent entries in a defined order

### M3: Docked mode

**Status:** NOT STARTED

- The palette docks at the top or the bottom of the window
- A docked palette does not take focus until the hotkey activates it
- Switching between floating and docked keeps search behavior the same
- Pressing the hotkey on an active docked palette unfocuses it and returns focus to the pane that had it
- On activation, the overlay's empty-query order reflects recency at that moment
- A click outside the overlay on something that cannot take focus, such as a status bar segment or a divider, returns
  focus to the pane focused before activation
- Whether the deactivating click also reaches the clicked terminal, such as a mouse-reporting vim, is defined
- The docked palette counts toward the window's minimum size from the pane tree
- When the docked palette and the status bar dock at the same edge, they stack in one defined order
- A top-docked palette does not sit under the traffic lights or break dragging by the top edge
- Clicking an inactive docked palette activates it
- Activating a docked palette does not resize the content area or any terminal
- The results overlay stays within the content area, grows away from the docked edge, and draws above terminal
  surfaces
- A click outside the active overlay deactivates the palette and focuses what was clicked
- The placeholder names the menu item's current key equivalent, including after an App Shortcuts remap
- Switching mode while the palette is active leaves it in a defined state, with focus on the field or on the prior pane
- The mode and dock position are settings in the Settings window, and an invalid value falls back to the default with
  a status bar warning

## Decision Log

- 2026-10-31: Drafted from the original write-up without an interview. The open questions hold everything undecided.
- 2026-11-01: Review start: 3 milestones, 4 settled decisions, 2 risks, 0 live-after lines or row gates; no
  out-of-scope statements; full review of the 4 open questions, autonomous mode, at commit 92da487.
- 2026-11-01: Split the open sections into six questions: tab publishing, command source, hotkey default, hotkey
  configurability, search scope, and ranking. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Applets publish tabs through a live query of the pane tree, with a per-pane change signal, the
  layout-change signal, and process-lifetime tab IDs. Entries target stable pane and tab IDs. Converged in 1 pass.
  (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Commands live in a Swift registry shared with uniterm's key bindings. They target the pane focused
  before the palette, and never run through Janet. Converged in 1 pass. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: The hotkey is Cmd-Shift-P in both modes, as one toggle. Converged in 1 pass. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: The hotkey is a fixed-title menu item, rebindable through macOS App Shortcuts. No in-app setting.
  Converged in 1 pass. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Rewrote the hotkey collision risk to low likelihood, since Cmd chords never reach the pty. Lowered the
  stale-entry risk to low. Added the muscle-memory risk (accepted) and the menu-title risk (mitigated). (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Search covers the current window only. Cross-window search is left undone, since it is a scope
  addition. Converged in 1 pass. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Results rank by fuzzy match with a bounded recency boost, kept in memory only. Each entry shows its kind.
  Converged in 1 pass. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Coherence review, full pass. Amended "How applets publish tabs": tab IDs were unique only within the
  running process; now they are never reused across a relaunch, since UTERM-003 may hand them to scripts that outlive
  a launch. Amended "Command source": text-editing chords go to the palette's field, since the binding rule as written
  sent Cmd-V and Cmd-Z to the pane behind it, against UTERM-001 M7. Run actions may start UI and return. Reworded the
  dispatch constraint, since the registry now owns uniterm's bindings. Routed the other findings to M1, M2, and M3.
  Added four open questions: other bindings while the field has focus, applets without tabs, default mode and dock
  edge, and what an inactive docked palette shows. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Tagged the command registry as an addition. It moves UTERM-001's key bindings onto a shared registry, a
  refactor of accepted work, to keep the palette and the bindings from drifting. The fixed-title menu item is the
  first app-menu decision in any proposal. (autonomous, addition)
- 2026-11-01: Added risks for UTERM-003 calling the main-thread registry (mitigated), rework of UTERM-001's bindings
  (accepted), and tab titles posing as commands (mitigated). (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: With the palette's field focused, Cmd-W dismisses the palette, and other bindings dismiss it and then
  run on the prior pane. Scoped the Cmd-W sameness rule to outside the field. Converged in 1 pass, after moving off
  hide-then-run for Cmd-W, which would close a tab with no dialog and no undo. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: The applet contract requires at least one tab. A tabless applet publishes one tab for its whole
  session. Converged in 1 pass. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: The palette is floating by default, and a docked palette defaults to the top edge. Converged in 1 pass.
  (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: An inactive docked palette shows a one-line field. Results appear as an overlay, so the content area
  never resizes. Converged in 1 pass. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Tagged "Applets without tabs" as an addition. It puts a one-tab requirement, with the per-tab duties, on
  the applets of UTERM-005 through UTERM-010. (autonomous, addition)
- 2026-11-01: Re-check pass. The bindings rule made the palette's own hotkey hide and reshow it, against "Hotkey
  default". Added a carve-out: the toggle hides or unfocuses and runs nothing else. Extended the Janet-thread risk to
  availability checks. Rewrote an M3 check that assumed an inactive docked palette shows a list. Routed the other
  findings to M1, M2, and M3. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Final re-check pass converged. Stated in the bindings decision's lead that the toggle is excepted. The
  Janet-thread risk also hands UTERM-003 how a Janet command reports availability. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Risk review: every risk carries a rating and a mitigation or acceptance. None is high likelihood and
  high impact. Tab IDs are not persisted, and the applet contract is internal, so neither is a one-way door. The menu
  title contract and the UTERM-003 exposure are listed. (autonomous)
- 2026-11-01: Review gate: kept all. The user kept the command registry, the palette menu item, and the one-tab
  requirement.
- 2026-11-01: ADR candidate (cuts across the system): every key binding, palette command, and later script call runs
  one registry action per command. Declined: the user chose not to write it.
- 2026-11-01: ADR candidate (cuts across the system): every applet publishes at least one tab, and tab IDs are never
  reused, even across a relaunch. Declined: the user chose not to write it.
- 2026-11-01: Accepted.
- 2026-11-01: Scheduled as UTERM-002 M1-M3 in queue.md.
- 2026-11-01: Amended "Command source" and M1 to match the accepted UTERM-013, before M1 starts. "Command source" said
  every UTERM-001 binding moves onto the registry. Now the standard edit actions stay on the responder chain, and M1
  gains a check that says so. Its "Leaves undone" said menus driven from the registry would be a scope addition with
  no menu decision behind it. It now says UTERM-013 makes menus read the registry. The decision's marker moved from the
  text-editing bullet to the decision's lead, so it covers both amendments. "Hotkey configurability" and the Impacts
  line on UTERM-001 said every uniterm binding runs a registry command. Both now leave out the standard edit actions.
- 2026-11-02: Amended "Command source" (work-queue best guess): a key, a menu item, and the palette reach an action
  through one dispatch point in the window, which applies the palette's rules. The decision said only that a binding
  and its command run the same action. The key route alone would have left a menu item chosen with the mouse outside
  the palette rules. Also recorded in M1's As built: the registry lives in WindowKit, and the palette sizes and ranking
  constants are the implementation's.
